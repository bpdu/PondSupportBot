## Architecture

The bot is built using:
- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)  
- [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) for Telegram API integration  
- [Flask / FastAPI (optional)](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for webhook handling  
- **Pond Mobile Support Knowledge Base** (internal API or predefined scripts)  

The bot operates in two modes:
1. **Polling Mode** (local testing/development)  
2. **Webhook Mode** (for production deployment on a server or cloud service)

---

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the bot locally or deploy it to production.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher  
- A Telegram account and a bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)  
- (Optional) A server or cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or Docker) for production deployment

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/pond-mobile-telegram-bot.git
cd pond-mobile-telegram-bot
````

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following variables:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<your_bot_token>
WEBHOOK_URL=<your_webhook_url>      # Required only if using webhooks
ADMIN_CHAT_ID=<your_admin_chat_id>  # For escalations and alerts
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` file or API tokens to version control. Use environment variables or a secure secrets manager.

---

## Running the Bot

### Development (Polling Mode)

```bash
python bot.py
```

### Production (Webhook Mode)

Ensure your webhook URL is configured with Telegram:

```bash
curl -F "url=<your_webhook_url>" https://api.telegram.org/bot<TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook
```

Start the production server:

```bash
gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8443 --workers 4
```

---

## Usage

Once the bot is running, customers can:

1. Open Telegram and search for the bot‚Äôs username (e.g., `@PondMobileSupportBot`)
2. Start the conversation by sending `/start`
3. Follow on-screen prompts for:

   * Checking network status
   * Configuring device APN settings
   * Activating SIM/service
   * Troubleshooting common errors (e.g., ‚ÄúNo Signal,‚Äù ‚ÄúData Not Working‚Äù)
4. If the bot cannot resolve the issue, it will offer to connect the user with **Pond Mobile technical support**.

### Example Commands

| Command            | Description                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `/start`           | Start interacting with the bot         |
| `/help`            | Display available support topics       |
| `/diagnose`        | Run network and device troubleshooting |
| `/contact_support` | Escalate to human technical support    |
